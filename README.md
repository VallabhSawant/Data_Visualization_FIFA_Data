# Data_Visualization_FIFA_Data
As I am a soccer fan, I was very keen to visualize the various abilities a player possesses and how they
affect his overall rating or credibility. The dataset has 18207 observations and 89 variables.
Using the above data, I plan to create visualizations that would help a club finalize a transfer for a highly
skilled fast-attacking player.
